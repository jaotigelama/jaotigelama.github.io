								<h3>The game</h3>
								<p>
									This game is a survival game where the player needs to keep track on is hunger and thirst bars,
									furthermore, at night, some enemies will appear. The game is a bit shallow,
									however it has multiple systems commonly used in games, these systems are as follows:
								</p>

								<ul>
									<li>
										<b>Save/Load system:</b> <br/>
										Gives the option to the player to save its progress, the game is saved in JSON,
										it is saved in a way that the character is not bound to a world giving the option to change the world and keeping the character and vice versa,
										it also autosaves working together with the day and night cycle.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Day and night:</b> <br/>
										A simple day and night cycle that simulates the passage of time, getting darker on night-time and fading in lights.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Inventory:</b> <br/>
										Gives the player the option to keep items, being able to use consumables, drop, equip, or craft items and rearrange their positions.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Crafting:</b> <br/>
										Based on the items in the inventory, the crafting system checks if the player can craft something,
										is something can be crafted it will appear in the crafting menu, cliquing on the item will remove the materials and place the crafted item,
										closing the menu in the process.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Equipment:</b> <br/>
										Same items can be equipped, giving armour that reduces the damage taken, or giving damage, equipment items have their respective slots,
										for example, it is not possible to equip a sword on the head.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Spawning:</b> <br/>
										At night enemies will appear, the type of enemies are random but certain types will only appear on a specific map terrain.
										Occasionally, a stronger unavoidable enemy will appear.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Procedural generation:</b> <br/>
										A map is generated for every world, having at the time only 2 types of terrain and 7 types of resources,
										the terrain is made of grass with small patches of dirt,
										with one of the corners of the map being a giant dirt patch making it a good biome to find same types of resources that are scarce on the rest of the map.
									</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>The Project</h3>
								<p>
									This project was a 2-month project with the objective of showcasing my knowledge and practice in unity,
									because of its objective, the game doesn’t go in depts.
									The multiple systems implemented can be easily expanded upon and reused in other projects,
									for the near future however, this game will be shelved.
								</p>
